I got the idea for this project when I realised how simillar my 3d printer was to a CNC machine and laser engravers since they both pretty much use the same technique for movement. So I did some research and I found that this has been explored before and I found youtube videos explaining the process and how to build one so I researched for the parts online and made the BOM here are the sources I used:
